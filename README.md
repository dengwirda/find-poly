## `FIND-POLY: Fast point(s)-in-polygon(s) queries in MATLAB`

A fast "point(s)-in-polygon(s)" routine for <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">`MATLAB`</a> / <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">`OCTAVE`</a>.

Given a collection of polygons and a set of query points, `FINDPOLY` determines the set of enclosing polygons for each point. Arbitrary collections of polygons and query points are supported, and general non-convex and multiply-connected inputs can be handled. `FINDPOLY` employs various spatial indexing + sorting techniques, and is reasonably fast for large problems.

Given `K` polygons (each with `M` edges on average) the task is to find the enclosing polygons for a set of `N` query points. The (obvious) naive implementation is expensive, leading to `O(K*M*N)` complexity (based on a simple loop over all polygons, and calling a standard points-in-polygon test for each individually). This code aims to do better:

* Employing a "fast" <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/inpoly">inpolygon routine</a>, reducing the complexity of each point(s)-in-polygon test (based on spatial  sorting) to approximately `O((N+M)*log(N))`.

* Employing a spatial tree (an <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/aabb-tree">`aabb-tree`</a>) to localise each points-in-polygon query within a spatially local "tile". This typically gains another logarithmic factor, so is a big win for large `K`.

### `Quickstart`

After downloading and unzipping the current <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/findpoly/archive/master.zip">repository</a>, navigate to the installation directory within <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">`MATLAB`</a> / <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">`OCTAVE`</a> and run the examples in `polydemo.m`.

For good performance in `OCTAVE`, the underlying `INPOLY` kernel can be compiled from `C++` as an `*.oct` file. See documentation on `MKOCTFILE` for additional information. Typically, `MATLAB`'s in-built `JIT`-acceleration leads to good performance by default.
